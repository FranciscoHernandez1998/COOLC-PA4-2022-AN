# COOLC-2022

Inside each folder you will find the code explained in class that provides a starting point for each phase of the compiler. Keep in mind that:

- YOU SHOULD MAKE YOUR OWN IMPLEMENTATION AND DON'T TAKE THIS AS A FULL OFFICIAL IMPLEMENTATION
- THIS MUST BE COMPLETED WHILE YOU KEEP ADVANCING
